# RMIT First Health iOS Hackathon Recap

**In collaboration with:** Apple, Northern Health, and Bilue

## The Challenge

> "How might Northern Health create an early warning system that helps detect deteriorating mental health patients before it becomes a crisis â€” without depending solely on phone calls and clinical visits?"

---

## Our Solution: Cliniwatch

We developed **Cliniwatch**, a proactive monitoring system designed to identify early signs of mental health deterioration. An app which consists of : 
A daily check in with a series of questions which can be customised by the carer with affirmations,
A nearby support page with a map integration to find Mental health clinics, psychiatrists close to the current location,
A log book which gamifies the platform with gardening streaks and aura points with future ideas of a journal and integration to apple health,
A built in contact list with their closest contacts and recommended support contacts
A carer page that the carer can access upon login to provide their perspective of the patient.
